                        <p class="mb10" style="color:white">The radar systems have been operated with numerous manned and unmanned aircraft, both vertical takeoff and fixed wing platforms, in multiple countries throughout the world. They have flown on small and large platforms ranging from the hand launched Aerovironment Puma to the UH60 Helicopter. The radar is robust and meets rigorous MIL-STD-810-G qualifications for use in harsh environments.</p>
